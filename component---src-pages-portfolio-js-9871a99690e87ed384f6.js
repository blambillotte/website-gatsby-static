Hating to do extra dishes, I would rather put a single bowl on the scale and measure only with weight. The source data that powers this tool comes from the USDA as raw files containing specifications for commodity food products. With a bit of cleaning and processing, we can then extrapolate standard volume to weight conversions. The data processing pipeline was done in Elixir with the hosted UI built with React, Firebase, and Algolia.","linkUrl":"https://usda-weight-converter.web.app/","linkTitle":"Ingredient Converter App"}}]}}}')}}]);
